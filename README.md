Churn Analysis by using Machine Learning Algorithms with Multiple Imputation Algorithms and Bayesian Optimization

Technological advancements and innovative approaches facilitated by these developments have made their presence felt in almost every industry today. As a result of these innovative approaches increasing competition in sectors, a decrease in customer loyalty has been observed. This situation has led many sectors to transition from a product or service-oriented marketing approach to a customer-centric marketing strategy.

The efforts of companies to acquire new customers for growth require more costly actions than retaining existing customers. It has been recognized that the analysis of potential customer losses is of high importance in sectors where the value of such analysis is crucial for the growth of firms. The most crucial step in being able to predict and take necessary and accurate actions based on anticipated customer losses is the accurate definition of lost customers. Anticipating customers who are likely to churn enables the firm to retain its valuable customers by offering personalized offers, conducting customer satisfaction-focused initiatives, and ultimately engaging in marketing activities that contribute to firm profitability.

The challenge in identifying lost customers varies across sectors. In sectors where there is a contractual relationship with customers, the ability to precisely identify lost customers enhances the reliability of analytical studies. For instance, companies in the telecommunications sector provide many services to customers based on specific contracts. Various conditions, such as commitment agreements within the scope of the contract, are considered during potential churn analyses. In contrast, for companies providing gym services where there is no contractual relationship with the customer and no cost to the customer for switching to sector competitors offering the same service, both identifying lost customers and predicting their behaviors are quite challenging.

This bachelor's thesis aims to present an effective churn prediction model using machine learning methods applied to customer data from a gym. Missing values in certain variables in the dataset have been analyzed using statistical methods. Based on the information obtained from the analysis of missing values, multiple imputation methods have been employed. For churn analysis, various models have been created using decision tree-based machine learning algorithms, and the hyperparameters of the models have been optimized using Bayesian optimization to find the most efficient hyperparameter values. The performance of the optimized models has been measured using various metrics. Evaluated models have been compared among themselves using possible model evaluation approaches. As a result of the evaluations, XGBoost and CatBoost algorithms have demonstrated more successful performance compared to the other algorithms considered. These findings indicate that machine learning and data analytics approaches can be effectively utilized in predicting gym membership cancellations, similar to other sectors, highlighting their value for companies in terms of growth.
